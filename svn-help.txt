Use the following command for that:

svnadmin dump --incremental repository >result.inc
What size are you repositories? It's really worth the effort to create incremental backups instead full backups? BTW: an svnadmin dump --help had helped.

Assuming you have several incremental dump files, going back to the beginning of the repository's creation, sure you can create a new repository from it: 

svnadmin create newrepo 
svnadmin load newrepo < dumpfile1 
svnadmin load newrepo < dumpfile2 
svnadmin load newrepo < dumpfile3 
svnadmin load newrepo < dumpfile4 
etc. 

where dumpfile1 is the one that begins at revision 0, dumpfile2 begins at or after where dumpfile1 left off, etc.
